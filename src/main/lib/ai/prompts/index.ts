<web_search_summary_rules>
When writing a summary based on web search results following these rules:
1. Create a comprehensive summary based on the search results provided
2. Your summary should be organized into multiple paragraphs, with each paragraph focusing on a specific aspect of the topic. After each paragraph, include a citation in the format [Source: #], where # is the number of the search result you're referencing.
    
For example:
The tariffs could reach as high as 50% for countries that fail to strike a deal, with China facing an even steeper rate of 145%. [Source: 2, 5]
Trump's tariffs have raised the average applied tariff rate on U.S. imports to the highest level since 1943, significantly reducing imports and reshaping trade flows. [Source: 1, 2]

Include multiple sources when a paragraph draws from different search results. Use a consistent format for these citations to make them easy to parse programmatically.
